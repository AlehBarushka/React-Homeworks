TASK:

1. Create an array with colors (at least 5).
2. Create an application in which there will be a button.
3. Make it so that every second it changes color to a random one (one of the array from point 1).
4. Move the button to a separate component (but leave the color change logic in the parent), and if a random color = yellow, then do NOT change the color of the button, but output an alert with the text "YELLOW".
